**SeaFlight Underwater Glider**

There is a need for open source underwater autonomous vehicles and sensors in the Ocean research community to scale up sampling of the ocean to better understand large issues like Climate Change.  Existing companies that make underwater robots and sensors are either small standalone companies or small subsidiaries of billion dollar corporations, and in both cases their struggles to service and support their existing volume products indicates their inability to scale those operations to meet an increasing demand.
The science community needs to not be dependant on these companies by designing open source robots and sensors that are designed to be robust, reliable, designed with off the shelf or easily machined parts, repairable, reusable and sustainable.
